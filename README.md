# üìä Indonesian Premium Rice Price Scraper (per Province)

This Python script is used to **scrape the average geometric price of Premium Rice** across all provinces in Indonesia, using data from the [National Food Price Panel](https://panelharga.badanpangan.go.id/). The data is stored in a `.csv` file for further analysis, visualization, or documentation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Use with Caution ‚Äì Connection May Be Interrupted

> **Please be cautious when running this script!**

### Reason:
- The government API enforces a **rate limit** (HTTP status **429**) if too many requests are sent in a short time.
- If your internet connection is unstable, the script may **fail to fetch data** or return non-JSON responses.
- Some provinces might not report data for certain dates.
- While automatic delays (`time.sleep`) are included, **using public Wi-Fi, VPNs, or unstable connections can worsen reliability**.
